# Setting up our GitHub Repositories


1. Log into GitHub on your browser, and navigate to [https://github.com/deerow22/EscapeEarth-test](https://github.com/deerow22/EscapeEarth-test) This will be our main project repository.
2. On the right of the window click on the "Fork" button. This will be your FORKED EscapeEarth repository. It is a new copy of the main repo.

3. Open Terminal. Use the `cd` command to navigate to your Desktop.
4. Use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory called "Internship". i.e. type `mkdir Internship`
5. Use the `cd` command to navigate into this Internship folder. (Keep the Terminal window open)
6. On your FORKED repo webpage click the green button on the right that says "Code". Copy the URL shown. WARNING: Make sure this url does NOT contain "deerow22" - that means you are not using your FORKED repo.
